#== Templates ==#

## A simple template that will wrap the `start()` and `stop()` calls around
## a block of code.  Make sure that the passed in Stopwatch has been
## initialized.  If the Stopwatch is already running, it will stop it it first.

#== Time Conversion Functions ==#

## Creates a new Stopwatch.  It has no laps and isn't running
proc stopwatch*(): Stopwatch =
  result = Stopwatch(
    running: false,
    startTicks: 0.Ticks,
    laps: @[],
    total: 0
  )


## Clones the state of an existing Stopwatch.  Will copy over it's laps and if
## it is currently running or not.
proc clone*(sw: var Stopwatch): Stopwatch =
  result = Stopwatch(
    running: sw.running,
    startTicks: sw.startTicks,
    laps: sw.laps,
    total: sw.total
  )


## Checks to see if the Stopwatch is measuring time.
proc running*(sw: var Stopwatch): bool =
  return sw.running


## Makes the Stopwatch measure time.  Will do nothing if the Stopwatch is
## already doing that.
proc start*(sw: var Stopwatch) =
  # If we are already running, ignore
  if sw.running:
    return

  # Start the lap
  sw.running = true
  sw.startTicks = getTicks()


## Makes the Stopwatch stop measuring time.  It will record the lap it has
## taken.  If the Stopwatch wasn't running before, nothing will happen
proc stop*(sw: var Stopwatch) =
  # First thing, measure the time
  let stopTicks = getTicks()

  # If not running, ignore
  if not sw.running:
    return

  # save the lap that we just made (and add it to the accum)
  let lapTime = stopTicks - sw.startTicks
  sw.laps.add(lapTime)
  sw.total += lapTime

  # Reset timer state
  sw.running = false
  sw.startTicks = 0.Ticks


## Clears out the state of the Stopwatch.  This deletes all of the lap data and
## will make it stop measuring time.
proc reset*(sw: var Stopwatch) =
  sw.running = false
  sw.startTicks = 0.Ticks
  sw.laps.setLen(0)   # Clear the laps
  sw.total = 0        # Zero the accum


## This function will clear out the state of the Stopwatch and tell it to start
## recording time.  It is the same as calling reset() then start().
proc restart*(sw: var Stopwatch) =
  sw.reset()
  sw.start()


## Returns the number of laps the Stopwatch has recorded so far.  If `incCur` is
## set to `true`, it will include the current lap in the count.  By default it
## set to `false`.
proc numLaps*(sw: var Stopwatch; incCur: bool = false): int =
  return sw.laps.len + (if incCur and sw.running: 1 else: 0)


## Returns the time (in nanoseconds) of a lap with the provided index of `num`.
## If `incCur` is set to `true`, it will include the current lap in the range
## (as the last lap).  By default it is set to `false`.  This function can raise
## an `IndexError` if `num` isn't a valid lap index.
##
## If you want to convert the returned value to a different time measurement,
## use one of the functions: `msecs()`, `usecs()` or `secs()`.
proc lap*(sw: var Stopwatch; num: int; incCur: bool = false): int64 =
  if incCur and sw.running:
    # Check if the index is good or not
    if num < sw.laps.len:
      # Return one of the previous laps
      return sw.laps[num]
    elif num == sw.laps.len:
      # Return the current lap
      return sw.nsecs
    else:
      # Out of bounds
      raise newException(IndexError, "provided lap number isn't valid.")
  else:
    # only look at completed laps
    return sw.laps[num]


## Returns a list of all the recorded laps (in nanoseconds).  If `incCur` is set
## `true`, then it will include the current lap in the result.  By default it is
## `false`.  If no lap is being recored, than `incCur` will be ignored.
##
## If you want to convert the returned value to a different time measurement,
## use one of the functions: `msecs()`, `usecs()` or `secs()` in conjunction
## with the `map()` function from the `sequtils` module.  Example:
##
## .. code-block:: nim
##   var sw = stopwatch()
##
##   # some time measurements later...
##
##   var lapsSecs = sw2.laps.map(proc(x: int64): float = secs(x))
##   echo lapsSecs
##   # --> @[1.000117, 0.500115, 0.200212]
proc laps*(sw: var Stopwatch; incCur: bool = false): seq[int64] =
  var
    curLap = sw.nsecs
    allLaps = sw.laps

  if sw.running and incCur:
    allLaps.add(curLap)

  return allLaps


## Removes a lap from the Stopwatch's record with the given index of `num`.
## This function has the possibility of raising an `IndexError`.  
proc rmLap*(sw: var Stopwatch; num: int) =
  # Remove its time from the accum
  let t = sw.laps[num]
  sw.total -= t

  sw.laps.delete(num)


## This clears out all of the lap records from a Stopwatch.  This will not
## effect the current lap (if one is being measured).
proc clearLaps(sw: var Stopwatch) =
  sw.laps.setLen(0)
  sw.total = 0


## This will return either the length of the current lap (if `stop()` has not
## been called, or the time of the previously measured lap.  The return value is
## in nanoseconds.  If no laps have been run yet, then this will return 0.
##
## See also: `usecs()`, `msecs()`, `secs()`

##
## See also: `nsecs()`, `msecs()`, `secs()`
