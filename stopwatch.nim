## Creates a new Stopwatch.  It has no laps and isn't running.  If you want to

## false otherwise

## Returns the time (in nanoseconds) of a lap with the provided index of `num`.

## (as the last lap).  By default it is set to `false`.  This function can raise
## an `IndexError` if `num` isn't a valid lap index.
##
## If you want to convert the returned value to a different time measurement,
## use one of the functions: `msecs()`, `usecs()` or `secs()`.

## `true`, then it will include the current lap in the result.  By default it is
## `false`.  If no lap is being recored, than `incCur` will be ignored.
##
## If you want to convert the returned value to a different time measurement,
## use one of the functions: `msecs()`, `usecs()` or `secs()` in conjunction
## with the `map()` function from the `sequtils` module.  Example:
##
## .. code-block:: nim
##   var sw = stopwatch()
##
##   # some time measurements later...
##
##   var lapsSecs = sw2.laps.map(proc(x: int64): float = secs(x))

##   # --> @[1.000117, 0.500115, 0.200212]
##
## If lapping is turned off this will return an empty sequence

## been called, or the time of the previously measured lap.  The return value is
